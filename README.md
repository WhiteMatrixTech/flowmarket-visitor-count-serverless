## How to deploy?

### Getting started

First, fork this project to your own GitHub account.

Second, acquire a Google API credential file following the procedure explained here: [Analytics Reporting API v4 - Enable the API](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v4/quickstart/service-py#1_enable_the_api). You will get a JSON credential which looks like:

```jsonc
{
  // ...
  "project_id": "ga-hit-count",
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nxxx-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
  "client_email": "blog-hit-count@ga-hit-count.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
  // ...
}
```

**You will need to add the `client_email` to your Google Analytics user, and grant permissions `Read and Analyze` if you haven't done so already.** Details: [Add, edit, and delete users and user groups](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1009702).

Finally, change `api/config.ts` according to your own Google API details.

| key           | value                                                                                                                   |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `viewId`      | Check Google Analytics Dashboard: Admin ¬ª View ¬ª View Settings                                                          |
| `projectId`   | Your Google API project ID. (From credentials JSON file.)                                                               |
| `privateKey`  | Your Google API private Key. **DO NOT CHANGE THIS!** (We will add this private key via Vercel environment variables.)   |
| `clientEmail` | Your Google API client email. (From credentials JSON file.)                                                             |
| `allFilter`   | The filter you wish to apply for your posts. (Default `['/20']`, because my posts' path begin with `/2019` or `/2020`.) |
| `startDate`   | The start date you wish to query your Google Analytics API. (Default `2010-01-01`, any date old enough should work.)    |

### Deploying to Vercel

[![Deploy to Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/import/project?template=spencerwooo%2Fga-hit-count-serverless)

After importing your forked version of this project to Vercel, you'll need to add your Google API private key to Vercel environment variable. Create a new variable named `PRIVATE_KEY` and copy the private key into it. **Your private key should look like this (i.e., remove all `\n` and replace with real linebreaks.):**

```
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
dageWvAIBADANBAokdP8WgkqhkiGkk
...
afROdsafbliOjPA==1Hk3mdsafEdBa
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
```

After this, trigger a new deploy to production.
